Bookbub Webscraping

Created a collection called 'books' which stored information about a book title, the amazon link for that bookb, and the rating

Inserted every title and the rating associated with the Amazon link connected to each title into the book collection

Created a helper function to add the rating to each 'book panel' on the website

Each book panel was obtained from Bookbub's Latest Deals Page
